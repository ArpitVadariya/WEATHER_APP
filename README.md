# Weather App (Backend - Node.js)

## 🌤️ Overview
Welcome to the **Weather App**, a backend-powered application built with **Node.js**! This project fetches real-time weather data for cities using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and returns it in **JSON** format. It features an intuitive frontend with a **homepage** for city search and a **city page** to display detailed weather information.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Weather Data Fetching**: Get accurate and real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Cache Memory**: To improve performance, weather data is cached for **10 minutes**, reducing unnecessary API calls for recently searched cities.
- **Frontend Pages**:
  - **Homepage** to search cities.
  - **City Page** to display weather data for the searched city.
- **Backend Focused**: Learn and implement backend concepts like **API integration** and **data caching**.
