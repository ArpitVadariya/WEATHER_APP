# Weather App (Backend - Node.js) 🌤️

## 📜 Overview
Welcome to the **Weather App**! Built with **Node.js**, this backend-powered application fetches real-time weather data for cities using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and returns it in a structured **JSON format**. 

It features:
- **Homepage** to search for cities.
- **City Page** to display weather details.
- **Cache memory** for reducing API calls by storing weather data for **10 minutes**.

The project emphasizes backend concepts like **API integration** and **data caching** to optimize performance.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🌍 **Real-Time Weather Fetching**: Get accurate weather details for cities via the OpenWeatherMap API.
- 💾 **Cache Memory**: Weather data is cached for **10 minutes** to minimize API calls and enhance performance.
- 🖥️ **Frontend Pages**:
  - **Homepage**: Search for any city.
  - **City Page**: View detailed weather information for a city.
- 🔧 **Backend-Focused**: Learn and implement key backend concepts such as **API integration**, **route handling**, and **data caching**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **Express.js** – Web framework for building the backend.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – API to fetch city weather data.
- **Cache Memory** – Reduces redundant API calls by caching data for **10 minutes**.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Search City**: On the homepage, enter the city name for which you want to see the weather.
2. **Display Weather**: The city’s weather data is fetched and shown on the **City Page**.
3. **Cache System**: Once data is fetched, it’s cached for **10 minutes** to avoid repetitive API calls for the same city.
